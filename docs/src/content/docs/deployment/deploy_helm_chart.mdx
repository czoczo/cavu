import importedChartValues from '../../../../../deployment/helm/values.yaml?raw';


## Prerequisites

:::note
[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.
:::
  
Using Helm, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add casavue https://casavue.app/helm-chart/
helm repo update
```

## Deployment
### Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release casavue/casavue
```
### Updating configuration

To change CasaVue configuration:

<Steps>
1. Copy `values.yaml` file content from [section below](/deployment/deploy_helm_chart/#configuration).
2. Modify content to your needs.
3. Save file as `values.yaml`.
4. Run:
   ```console
   helm upgrade my-release -f values.yaml
   ```
 </Steps>
:::caution[Accessing application]
CasaVue pod needs manual restart to read configuration changes.
:::

### Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the my-release deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```


The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
