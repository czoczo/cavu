Since CasaVue is ment to be a index frontpage for applications hosted on a Kubernetes, the easiest way to deploy CasaVue is with use of [Helm](https://helm.sh/):

```console
helm repo add casavue https://casavue.app/helm-chart/
helm install casavue/casavue
```

:::note[Accessing application]
Accessing applications hosted on Kubernetes is beyond scope of this document. Neverheless, assuming having access to the cluster with `kubectl` command, CasaVue deployment can be tested with below commands:
```console
export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=casavue,app.kubernetes.io/instance=casavue" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
kubectl port-forward $POD_NAME 8080:80
```
App should be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8080.
