description: How to modify CasaVue behaviour if needed.

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import importedCfgMain from '../../../../../config/main.yaml?raw';
import importedCfgItems from '../../../../../config/items.yaml?raw';

The less config the better! CasaVue is fully functional running on default configuration. Nevertheless, there are some configuration possibilities.  

CasaVue configuration consists of two files: `main.yaml` and `items.yaml`.

Despite editing configuration differs depending on deployment method ([Helm Chart](/deployment/deploy_helm_chart/#configuration) or [Docker Compose](/deployment/deploy_docker/#editing-configuration)), body of YAML configuration is the same.

Below is an example of their contents with a description of the fields.

## Main configuration file
If you want to modify CasaVue apperance, modyfing default main config file should be enough.

<Code code={importedCfgMain} lang="yaml" title="main.yaml" />

## Static items definitions
If you need to add a couple of entries from yourself in addition to the Kubernetes ones (or in case there is no entries from K8s), add the entries to the `items.yaml` file according to the example.

<Code code={importedCfgItems} lang="yaml" title="items.yaml" />
