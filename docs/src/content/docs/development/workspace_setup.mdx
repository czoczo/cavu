Before developing the code, there are a few steps to follow. 
<Steps>
1. Make sure you have all the required dependencies installed:
   - [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
   - [Vue](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start)
   - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) (other Vue compatible package managers, should also work)

2. Download the source code from GitHub. There are usually three methods to choose from. Use the one that suits you best.
   ```sh
   # HTTPS:
   git clone https://github.com/czoczo/cavu.git
   
   # SSH:
   git clone git@github.com:czoczo/cavu.git
   
   # GitHub CLI:
   gh repo clone czoczo/cavu
   ```
   
3. Build Vue frontend   
   ```sh
   cd frontend
   pnpm install
   pnpm run build
   cd ..
   ```

4. Build CasaVue binary
   ```sh
   go mod init casavue
   go mod tidy
   go build
   ```
</Steps>

Moreover, should you want to change anything in frontend, you can use Vue in [dev server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/) mode to have a live view of introduced changes.
 ```sh
 cd frontend
 pnpm install
 pnpm run dev
 ```
